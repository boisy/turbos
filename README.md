# TurbOS

## Introduction

TurbOS is a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) for the [Turbo9](http://github.com/turbo9team/turbo9).
It takes inspiration from the 6809-based [OS-9 operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS-9) that was once available from [Microware Systems Corporation](http://www.microware.com/), as well as the [NitrOS-9 Project](http://github.com/n6il/nitros9).
However, it isn't tied to the designs and assumptions of those operating systems.

The Turbo9 is a modern implementation of the classic 6809 instruction set, and as such, is extensible.
With careful consideration for new features and instructions that the Turbo9 may implement, TurbOS aspires to be the operating system that takes
advantage of the Turbo9 as it evolves.
