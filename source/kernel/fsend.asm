;;; F$Send
;;;
;;; Send a signal to a process.
;;;
;;; Entry:  A = The process ID of the process to receive the signal.
;;;         B = The signal to send.
;;;
;;; Exit:  CC = Carry flag clear to indicate success.
;;;
;;; Error:  B = A non-zero error code.
;;;        CC = Carry flag set to indicate error.
;;;
;;; The signal is a single byte value in the rage 0 through 255. If the destination process
;;; is sleeping or waiting, the kernel activates the process so that it can process the signal.
;;; If the process installed a signal intercept routine using F$Icpt, F$Send calls into it.
;;; Otherwise, the signal terminates the receiving process, and the process returns that
;;; signal as its exit status. An exception is the wakeup signal: S$Wake. It doesn't cause
;;; the kernel to invoke signal intercept routine.
;;;
;;; The signal codes are:
;;;
;;;            - S$Kill - terminate the process (cannot be intercepted)
;;;            - S$Wake - wake up the process.
;;;            - S$Abort - keyboard termination sequence typed
;;;            - S$Intrpt - keyboard interrupt sequence typed
;;;
;;; The kernel reserves all signal between 0 and 127. Signals 128 to 255 are user-defined
;;; and can be used for interprocess communication.
;;;
;;; If you call F$Send for a process that has a signal pending, the kernel returns an error.
;;; In that case, call F$Sleep for a few ticks to save CPU time, then try F$Send again.
