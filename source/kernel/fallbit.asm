* Calculate address of first byte we want, and which bit in that byte, from
* a bit allocation map given the address of the map & the bit # we want to point to.
*
* Entry: D = The bit number we want.
*        X = The pointer to the bitmap table.
*
* Exit:  A = A mask that has the bit number within byte we are starting on.
*        X = The pointer in allocation map to first byte we are starting on.
*
* Example 1:
* We want bit 18 starting at address 1024. Pass 18 to D and 1024 to X.
* We get back 128 in A (bit 7 set) and 1026 in D (the address of the bit).
*
* Example 2:
* We want bit 5 starting at address 3000. Pass 5 to D and 3000 to X.
* We get back 8 in A (bit 3 set) and 3000 in D (the address of the bit).
