;;; F$NProc
;;;
;;; Execute the next process in the active process queue.
;;;
;;; Entry: None.
;;;
;;; Exit:  None. Control doesn't return to the caller.
;;;
;;; F$NProc takes the next process out of the active process queue and initiates its execution.
;;; If the queue doesn't contain a process, the kernel waits for an interrupt and then checks the
;;; queue again. The process calling F$NProc must already be in one of the three process queues.
;;; If it isn't, it becomes unknown to the system even though the process descriptor still exists
;;; and can be displayed by `procs`.
