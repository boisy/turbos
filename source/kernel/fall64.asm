;;; F$All64
;;;
;;; Allocate a 64 byte block of memory.
;;;
;;; Entry: X = The base address of the page table; 0 = allocate the page table.
;;;
;;; Exit: A = The block number of the allocated 64 byte block.
;;; X = The base address of the page table.
;;; Y = The address of the block.
;;;
;;; Error: B = A non-zero error code.
;;; CC = Carry flag set to indicate error.
;;;
;;; F$All64 allocates a 64 byte block of memory by splitting 256 byte pages into four 64 byte blocks.
;;; The kernel uses the first 64 bytes of the base page as a page table. The page table holds up to 64
;;; MSB (most significant byte) references to allocated 256 byte pages.
;;;
;;; If you call F$All64 with X set to zero, F$All64 allocates a new base page and the first 64 byte memory block.
;;;
;;; Whenever a new 256 byte page is needed, F$All64 calls F$SRqMem to allocate 256 bytes of memory.
;;;
;;; The first byte of each block contains the block number, so only the remaining 63 bytes are usable.
;;; Routines using F$All64 shouldn't alter this first byte.
;;; 
;;; The following diagram shows how 64 byte blocks might be allocated in two 256 byte pages located at $3000 and
;;; $3600, respectively:
;;;
;;; -------------------------
;;; Base Page --> | $30/$36 | $30 |
;;; $3000 | Page Table | 64 bytes |
;;; | 64 bytes | |
;;; |------------ ------------|
;;; | $30 | $30 |
;;; | 64 bytes | 64 bytes |
;;; | | |
;;; -------------------------
;;;
;;; -------------------------
;;; Next Page --> | $36 | $36 |
;;; $3600 | 64 bytes | 64 bytes |
;;; | | |
;;; |-------------------------|
;;; | $36 | |
;;; | 64 bytes | 64 bytes |
;;; | | |
;;; -------------------------
;;;
;;; In this example, the first 256 byte page at $3000 is the base page. All four of its 64 byte blocks are allocated
;;; with the first block acting as the page table. Its first two bytes are $30 and $36 which are the MSBs of the addresses
;;; of the allocated pages.
;;; The next 256 byte page at $3600 has three of its four 64 byte blocks allocated and one remaining free. The first byte
;;; of each of the allocated 64 byte blocks contains the MSB of the 256 byte address of its block.
