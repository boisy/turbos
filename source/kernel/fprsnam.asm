;;; F$PrsNam
;;;
;;; Parse a pathlist.
;;;
;;; Entry:  X = The address of the pathlist to parse.
;;;         U = Starting address of the routineâ€™s memory area.
;;;
;;; Exit:   X = The address of the character past the optional "/".
;;;         Y = The address of the last character plus one.
;;;         A = The trailing delimiter character.
;;;         B = The length of the pathlist.
;;;        CC = Carry flag clear to indicate success.
;;;
;;; Error:  B = A non-zero error code.
;;;         Y = The address of the first non-delimiter character.
;;;        CC = Carry flag set to indicate error.
;;;
;;; F$PrsNam scans the input text string for a legal name. It terminates the name with any character that is not a legal name character.
;;; It's useful for processing pathlist arguments passed to a new process.
;;; Because it processes only one name, you need several calls to process a pathlist that has more than one name. 
;;; F$PrsNam completes with Y in position for the next element in the pathlist to parse.
;;; If  Y is at the end of a pathlist, a bad path error returns.
;;; It then moves the pointer in Y past any space characters so that it can parse the next pathlist in a command line.
;;;
;;; Before the Parse Name call:
;;;
;;; |  /  |  D  |  0  |  /  |  P  |  A  |  Y  |  R  |  O  |  L  |  L  |
;;;    X	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
;;;
;;; After the Parse Name call:
;;;
;;; |  /  |  D  |  0  |  /  |  P  |  A  |  Y  |  R  |  O  |  L  |  L  |
;;;          X	     Y              B = 2
